Tutorials and exercises from The Odin Project: http://www.theodinproject.com/home

The goal of this exercises is to improve my web development knowledge with Rails technologies. Currently, I'm skipping some of the courses from the Ruby Programming section because they are designed for people new to programming, talking about basic Ruby and CS concepts that I already knew. I find them interesting as a refreshment, but the exercise are not a challenge for me.

== Exercises in this repository:
*  android-logo: An animated android logo in HTML and CSS. The animation should work correctly with Firefox. In case you're using Chrome, please switch to a real browser
*  google: A visual replica of the Google front page as of July 10th 2014
*  sketchpad: A small JQuery exercise where you start with a sketchpad of squares that grow brighter as you pass your mouse over them
*  learn_ruby: A collection of exercises designed to learn ruby from http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby. All solved.
*  blogger: A Rails official tutorial where you build a blog application. I've also done all the optional section. This exercise inspired me to start my first Rails project on my own, called Phorum :-)
